Yesterday I walked around town with my AT-D878UV blasting APRS signals to
measure the reception of my I-Gate. Turns out, it has horrible reception! I
suspect it's because of the antenna, the tiny ~10cm-long one that my RTL-SDR
came with. It seems I'll have to hook up it up to a better antenna. Perhaps the
big one on my window?
