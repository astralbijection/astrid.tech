I fought the node, and unfortunately, the node won. For some reason, it's extremely difficult to set up a dependency structure where there's a library and an executable depending on it, while using TypeScript and ES6 imports. I could just be a dumbass, which might very well be the case, but I spent the last 8 hours trying to do it and I give up now.
