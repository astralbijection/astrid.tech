This project is an internal cloud that is scaled enough to meet the demands of a
single pleb like me.

## Goals of this project

- Learn how to use industry-standard DevOps tools
- Try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Give these old devices an actual use

### Hardware

#### Flexible Home Resources

These resources share a variety of workloads.

Here's what it all looks like.

#### Turnkey Home Resources

These resources are dedicated to one purpose and one purpose only.

| Name   | Model              | Role                                             |

| BANANA | Lenovo Legion Y530 | Personal Computer: development, work, and gaming |

#### External Cloud Resources

Unfortunately, my internet connection is slow, so anything I want others to be
able to use has to be hosted on an external cloud.

| Name      | Provider | Price ($/mo) | Arch  | Processor      | Cores | RAM (GB) | Role                |

| **Total** | ---      | 7.90         | ---   | ---            | **6** | **8**    | **Wasting my Time** |

[^fn-1]:
    My mom complained about it being really slow, and even with Linux, it's
    still slow. Thus, it's worse than crap.

[^fn-2]:
    This is my old laptop. I pulled it out of my backpack one day and saw the
    screen completely cracked for no good reason whatsoever.

    Zerg rushing is essentially the "quantity-over-quality" tactic in strategy
    games: you send many expendable units against the enemy to hopefully
    overwhelm them.

### Management Utilities

- Ansible -- Declaratively configuring servers
- Terraform -- Declaratively provisioning resources

### Things I no longer use

- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat, Metricbeat) -- This eats
  up a ridiculous amount of resources. As in, 6 GB (after attempts to minimize
  it) just dedicated to logging on a 28 GB cluster.
