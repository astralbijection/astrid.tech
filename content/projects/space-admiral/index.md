A real-time multiplayer strategy game similar to games in the Total War
franchise, but set in a space opera setting. Although it was unfinished, it was
a useful prototype for learning about additional kinds of trees.

## Implementation details

- Uses k-d trees to expedite range and nearest-neighbor searches
- Uses unit testing to ensure the proper function of individual components
- Code is structured in a dependency injection style for modularity
