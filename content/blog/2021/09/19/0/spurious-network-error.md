For some reason, my the automated build action for the Webmention receiver is failing due to spurious network errors. They're definitely spurious, but they've been consistently happening for the last several hours. I hope [this strange workaround](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6513#issuecomment-920920238) fixes it.
