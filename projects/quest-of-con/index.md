![A screenshot from the game.](./game-screenshot.png)

A science fiction turn-based strategy game. My friends were all making
turn-based strategy games at the time and I thought it would be fun to hop on
the bandwagon.

This was my first experience with any form of multiplayer/networking code. I was
successfully able to have two machines playing on the same game instance by
using a client-server architecture.
